        "text": "The group exhibition Grabeland (Future Splendors) will take place from 17/09/21 to 09/10/21 in various allotment gardens in Leipzig East. The two-part exhibition looks at the history of allotment garden culture from the perspective of a socialist approach. Given the background of advancing urbanization and the accompanying loss of fertile soil, the question of distribution of - and access to - usable land and cultivable land arises. What is the value of growing one's own food in an increasingly automated living environment? Where are the points of intersection between gardening and a concept of art that seeks to elude neoliberal systems of values? What forms of dialogue exist between humxns as well as non-humxn beings? Away from an anthropocentric self-understanding, the exhibition aims to present perspectives on interspecific relationships to land and landscape." }
